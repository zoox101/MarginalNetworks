I'd like to thank my committee chair, Dr. McGovern, for taking me under her wing and introducing me into the incredible world of machine learning. For keeping me on track, reviewing countless drafts (that I often provided five minutes before the deadline), and giving me every opportunity to succeed, I could not have asked for a better advisor. 

I'd like to thank committee member, Dr. Hougen, his support over the years and for introducing me to academic research. When I came to OU four years ago, all I wanted to do was publish a paper and you went out of your way to give me that opportunity. Rio 2018! I still owe you a round of frisbee golf.

I'd like to thank Dr. Grant, for serving on this committee and providing a source of inspiration over the years. Hobby Robbie may not have been my most successful project, but it taught me a lot, and inspired me to push forward with my degree in Computer Science.

I'd like to thank my family, my dad Garry, my mom Lisa, and my brother Alex, for giving me this opportunity to learn and grow and for supporting me through all the ups and downs. I really couldn't have done it without you all. 

Finally, I want to thank my best friends, Gabe, Trevor, and Catherine for looking out for me and keeping me sane throughout this whole process. Seriously, you all are the best.
