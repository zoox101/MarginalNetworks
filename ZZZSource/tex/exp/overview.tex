\update{In the following experiments, we test each of our hypotheses and discuss the results in the corresponding section.}

\paragraph{Experiment 1:} \update{Tests our implementation against PyGAM on the ellipse dataset to examine how well our network approximates a standard GAM.}

\paragraph{Experiment 2:} \update{Tests an instance in the Sloan Sky Survey dataset where our network outperforms traditional GAMs due to better marginal fitting.} 

\paragraph{Experiment 3:} \update{Tests our network against datasets that GAMs are incapable of fitting.}

\paragraph{Experiment 4:} \update{Tests our network against a number of real-world datasets to see if the decrease in power is significant in real-world classification tasks.}

\paragraph{Experiment 5:} \update{Tests the performance of our network as part of a larger convolutional net on the Pandemic dataset.}
